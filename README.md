# Algorithms & Data Structures
A list of Algorithm and Data Structure problems created from scratch as well as some taken from Leetcode and Hackerrank (Links are provided for coding problems taken from those sites). Each problem includes a description of a problem, a link in which it was found, solutions to the problem, and test cases. 

## Data Structure Topics	
* Array
    - Matrix
* Stack
* Queue
* Hash Tables
* Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
* Trees 
    - Binary Search Tree (BST) 
    - Binary Tree

## Algorithm Topics
* Binary Search
* Linear Search
* Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Pre-Order
    - In-Order
    - Post-Order
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
    - Level-Order
* Recursion
* Hashing

## How to get started
From your terminal <br/>
*Clone this repo*
```
 git clone https://github.com/sfahadh/JS_Algorithms-DataStructure.git
 cd JS_Algorithms-DataStructure
```

Open this folder in a text editor <br/>
*Direct yourself to a folder with a list of problems and choose which problems you want to work on*
```
cd LeetCode/Easy
```

*Solve one of the problems in the problem.js file and then run the following command* <br/>
Example: name_of_problem/test_file
```
jest Depth-of-Array/problem.test.js
```

If you passed all test cases, Congratulations! You can move on to the next problem set, if not try again.
