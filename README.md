# JavaScript Tree Algorithms
A series of tree related problems to help those new to the tree data structure. Each problem includes a description of the problem, test cases to check whether a correct solution of the problem was given or not, and solutions to the problem if all hope seems lost when trying to solve the problem. 

## Tree Topics	
    - Binary Search Tree (BST) 
    - Binary Tree
    - More will be included soon...

## Algorithm Topics
* Binary Search
* Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Pre-Order
    - In-Order
    - Post-Order
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
    - Level-Order
* Recursion

## How to get started
From your terminal <br/>
*Clone this repo*
```
 git clone https://github.com/sfahadh/JS_Tree_Algorithms.git
 cd JS_Tree_Algorithms
```

Open this folder in a text editor <br/>
*Direct yourself to a folder with a list of problems and choose which problems you want to work on*
```
cd BinarySearchTree
```

*Solve one of the problems in the problem.js file and then run the following command* <br/>
Example: BST-Traversal/name_of_problem/test_file
```
jest BST-Traversal/Inorder-Traversal/problem.test.js
```

If you passed all test cases, Congratulations! You can move on to the next problem set, if not try again.
