# Algorithms & Data Structures
A list of Algorithm and Data Structure problems from Leetcode and Hackerrank. Each problem includes a description of a problem, a link in which it was found, solutions to the problem, and test cases. 

## Data Structure Topics	
* Array
    - Matrix
* Stack
* Queue
* Hash Tables
* Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
* Trees 
    - Binary Search Tree (BST) 
    - Binary Tree

## Algorithm Topics
* Binary Search
* Linear Search
* Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Pre-Order
    - In-Order
    - Post-Order
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
    - Level-Order
* Recursion
* Hashing

## How to get started
From your terminal <br/>
*Clone this repo*
```
 git clone https://github.com/sfahadh/JS_Algorithms-DataStructure.git
 cd JS_Algorithms-DataStructure
```

Open this folder in a text editor <br/>
*Direct yourself to a folder with a list of problems and choose which problems you want to work on*
```
cd LeetCode/Easy
```

*Solve one of the problems in the problem.js file and then run the following command* <br/>
Example: name_of_problem/test_file
```
jest Depth-of-Array/problem.test.js
```

If you passed all test cases, Congratulations! You can move on to the next problem set, if not try again.
